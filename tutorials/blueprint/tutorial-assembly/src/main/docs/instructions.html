<h1>Setting up</h1>

<p>This set of instructions will take you through modifying and
running the code in the tutorial. To run through the tutorial you will
need:

<ul>
	<li>A laptop</li>
	<li>Java (Version 1.6 or greater)</li>
	<li>Maven (Version 2.2.1 or greater)</li>
	<li>A working network connection</li>
</ul>


<p>Before beginning the tutorial code we need to check that you can
run the OSGi platform and applications. We will refer to the directory
that you extracted the zip or tar file in as [toplevel]. We will use
Linux commands in the instructions - if you don't know what the
equivalent Windows commands are please ask.</p>

<p>To check that you are able to run the OSGi sample code run these
commands from a shell prompt:</p>
<div class=code>cd [toplevel]/scripts<br>
./start_platform.sh</div>
<p>You should see the Equinox OSGi console come up. The 'ss' command
lists the state of the platform. Issue the 'ss' command:
<div class=code>osgi> ss</div>
You should see 8 bundles (numbered 0-7).

<p>Leave this running in one window as we will return to it later. Open a new window/shell, we
will use the new shell to run some samples.</p>

<p>In the new shell, change directory to [toplevel]/bin and copy the following
three files into the [toplevel]/dropins directory:</p>
<div class=code>org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api-0.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar<br>
org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi-0.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar<br>
org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi-0.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar<br>
</div>
<p>This installs those bundles in the OSGi framework. Back in the OSGi console window, type 'ss' again, you should see
three new bundles in the 'INSTALLED' state. Start all three new bundles
starting with the <b>greeter.server.osgi</b> bundle. To do this, issue the 'start' command
followed by the bundle ID:</p>
<div class=code>osgi> start [ID]</div>
<p>Where 'ID' is the number of the bundle.</p>

<p>When you start the <b>greeter.client.osgi</b> bundle you will see some output - we
will come back to this later in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Back in the other shell, navigate to [toplevel]/dropins and
delete everything - this will uninstall the bundles.</p>

<p>Finally check the OSGi console to confirm that the three
bundles have gone by issuing another 'ss' command.</p>

<p>Later in the tutorial you will be using Maven to build the sample
code. 

<h1>Converting the OSGi Client.</h1>

<p>The projects org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi,
org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi and 
org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api
together comprise a simple application demonstrating
publication and consumption of an OSGi service. By following the steps
below, you will gradually migrate the application to use blueprint,
which will demonstrate how blueprint can help to simplify such projects.</p>

<p>In the next section ('Minimum conversion') we will go through the
minimum number of steps necessary to convert the client code to use
blueprint. In the section after that ('Finishing the client') we will go
through some more extensive changes to the client which extend its use
of blueprint.</p>

<h2>Minimum conversion</h2>


<p>In this section we will take the minimum number of actions to
convert the greeter client application to use blueprint.</p>

<p>First, take a look at the the client class, the source is located here:</p>
<div class=code>
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/java/org/apache/aries/tutorials/blueprint/greeter/client/osgi/ClientBundleActivator.java
</div>
<p>This class (activator) does two things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Instantiates the test class (GreeterTestClient)</li>
	<li>Invokes the 'doRequests()' method from the GreeterTestClient
	class.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Removing the activator</h3>


<p>In the following steps we will develop blueprint to carry out the tasks that are currently handled by the activator, the first
step is to delete the activator class. For example, on linux:</p>
<div class=code>rm
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/java/org/apache/aries/tutorials/blueprint/greeter/client/osgi/ClientBundleActivator.java
</div>
<p>The next step is to edit the file
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/pom.xml, and remove the line:</p>
<div class=code>&lt;Bundle-Activator&gt;org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi.ClientBundleActivator&lt;/Bundle-Activator&gt;
</div>

<h3>Replacing the functionality of the activator with blueprint</h3>


<p>If you were to rebuild the bundle at this point it would still
build and deploy, but without the activator the test class would not be
invoked and there would be no output when the client bundle was started.
In this step we will use blueprint to replace what the activator was
doing - creating an instance of the test class and calling one of its
methods.</p>


<p>Start by adding an OSGI-INF/blueprint directory under the
org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/resources folder:</p>
<div class=code>mkdir -p
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint
</div>
<p>In the newly created blueprint directory, create a blueprint.xml
file containing the following blueprint 'template'.</p>
<div class=code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"&gt;<br>
&lt;/blueprint&gt;<br>
</div>

<p>Note: The name of the file can be anything you like that ends in
.xml - blueprint.xml is a popular choice.</p>

<p>Now, add a bean element to represent the test class; remember the
activator was used to create an instance of this class, now we will use blueprint to do
the same. Add the bean element shown below within the blueprint XML element.</p>
<div class=code>&lt;bean id="clientBean" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi.GreeterTestClient"&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</div>
<p>The blueprint container will attempt to instantiate the class
(GreeterTestClient) with a zero argument constructor by default. However
- there is no zero argument constructor in the GreeterTestClient class;
the only constructor has the signature GreeterTestClient(BundleContext
b, String clientID). We can tell blueprint to use this by adding some
arguments inside the bean like this:</p>
<div class=code>&lt;argument ref="blueprintBundleContext"/&gt;<br>
&lt;argument value="My blueprint client ID"/&gt;<br>
</div>
<p>These arguments will be fed to the constructor. The string "My
blueprint client ID" will be used directly, while the
'blueprintBundleContext' references a special bean - we are not going to
worry about this now, it's beyond the scope of the tutorial.</p>

<p>If we were to build and deploy now, we'd discover the
GreeterTestClient is constructed, but the 'doRequests' method is not invoked.</p>

<p>For this last part of the puzzle, we'll use the blueprint bean
'init-method' attribute, which specifies a method to be called after a
bean is constructed. To use the 'init-method', add</p>
<div class=code>init-method="doRequests"</div>
<p>to the bean element. You should now have something like this in
your blueprint xml file:</p>
<div class=code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;bean id="clientBean" class="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi.GreeterTestClient"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;init-method="doRequests"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;argument value="My blueprint client ID"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;argument ref="blueprintBundleContext"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/bean&gt;<br>
&lt;/blueprint&gt;<br>
</div>
<p>Finally we need to build and re-deploy the client we have just
changed.</p>

<p>To build the code, run the script build.sh (or build.bat) in the
[toplevel]/scripts directory. If you are using your own Maven repository
the commands are:</p>
<div class=code>./build.sh org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api.osgi<br>
./build.sh org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi<br>
./build.sh org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi<br>
</div>

<p>To run your sample, from the the [toplevel]/scripts directory:</p>
<div class=code>./run.sh</div>
<p>this will copy the jar files generated in the build step to
[toplevel]/dropins and hence install the application.</p>

<p>Now look back to the OSGi console, start the bundles (server
first!), and check that they run. Clean the dropins directory again by
removing all the files from it.</p>


<p>At this point we have a blueprint client running without a bundle
activator. However, when we look at the content of the
GreeterTestClient class, it's doing all sorts of OSGi service related things
that blueprint could do much more simply. In the next section we will see how
use of blueprint can lead to much a much cleaner service invocation.</p>

<h2>Finishing the client</h2>


<p>The client code (GreeterTestClient) was written to demonstrate a
few common approaches to invoking an OSGi service. For example, there is
a proxy class, hiding a tracker, which passes the requests on
to the service (see inner class GreeterMessageServiceProxy). The really quite nasty 
'look it up and use it all in one hit.. ' approach
is demonstrated in the method doRequestUsingImmediateLookup().</p>

<p>Those experienced with OSGi will recognise the usual hidden
selection of service usage bugs, for example, failing to unget the
service in all cases, not handling situations when the service goes away
after being looked up, etc.</p>

<p>Blueprint can help us avoid most of the common errors
demonstrated in this code. So, let's get started and convert this client
code to use blueprint.</p>

<h3>Removing the old test implementations</h3>


<p>The current contents of the client is written to show various
OSGi ways of invoking a service. Since we're going to have blueprint
take care of this for us, we can remove the old OSGi service API usage.</p>

<p>In the class:</p>
<div class=code>
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/java/org/apache/aries/tutorials/blueprint/greeter/client/osgi/GreeterTestClient.java
</div>
<p>Remove the following methods:
<ul>
	<li>doRequestUsingImmediateLookup</li>
	<li>doRequestUsingTracker</li>
	<li>doRequestUsingCachedService</li>
</ul>

<p>Also remove:
<ul>
	<li>The inner class 'GreeterMessageServiceProxy'</li>
	<li>The field 'owningContext'</li>
	<li>The field 'cachedService'</li>
	<li>The field 'tracker'</li>
	<li>The entire content of the constructor method, except the first
	line.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, you should have removed everything from the class
except:
<ul>
	<li>The field 'clientID'</li>
	<li>The field 'proxy'</li>
	<li>The first line of the constructor</li>
	<li>The 'doRequests' method.</li>
	<li>The 'doRequestUsingProxy' method.</li>
	<li>The 'printResult' method.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Preparing for blueprint</h3>


<p>In this section we will add code that makes the client a lot more
like a java-bean by adding a setter for the proxy and removing the old
bundle context related elements from both the Java code and blueprint
xml.</p>

<p>Continuing to edit the GreeterTestClient class, remove all but
the first two lines of the 'doRequests' method, it should now just
contain:</p>
<div class=code>System.out.println("Proxy based...");<br>
doRequestUsingProxy();</div>

<p>Now add a setter for the proxy,</p>
<div class=code>public void setProxy(GreeterMessageService p){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this.proxy = p;<br>
}</div>
<p>and, since we're not using it any more, remove the BundleContext
from the class constructor. Like this:

<div class=code>public GreeterTestClient(String clientID) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this.clientID = clientID;<br>
}<br>
</div>

<p>Finally, save and close the GreeterTestClient class.

<p>The last step is to modify the blueprint xml to reflect these
changes. Edit the blueprint xml you created earlier:</p>
<div class=code>
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/resources/OSGI_INF/blueprint/blueprint.xml
</div>
<p>Remove the following line from the blueprint xml</p>
<div class=code>&lt;argument ref="blueprintBundleContext"/&gt;</div>
<p>This ensures that the blueprint matches the modified constructor in the
GreeterTestClient class.</p>


<h3>Adding blueprint to the client</h3>


<p>At this point we have code which will compile, but is not yet
complete. We have a client that will instantly null pointer if we
attempt to run it. Looking back at the GreeterTestClient class, when the
doRequests() method is invoked by the init-method declaration in the
blueprint xml, this in turn calls doRequestUsingProxy() which calls
getGreetingMessage() on the proxy variable. However, this variable is
initialised to null and never changed.</p>

<p>We need to make sure we set the 'proxy' variable. We can do this
using blueprint!</p>

<p>Back in the xml file:</p>
<div class=code>
[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi/src/main/resources/OSGI_INF/blueprint/blueprint.xml
</div>

<p>Add a 'reference' element, that refers to the greeter service. To
do this add the folowing xml inside &lt;blueprint&gt; but not inside the
&lt;bean&gt; element.</p>
<div class=code>&lt;reference id="greeterService" interface="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api.GreeterMessageService"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout="10000" availability="mandatory"/&gt;</div>
<p>This sets up a blueprint component with the ID 'greeterService',
which will appear to its users as an instance of the interface
specified, with its implementation being backed by an OSGi service
claiming to meet that interface.</p>

<p>Note: This is the most simple possible blueprint service - there
are many more powerful ways to use services within blueprint.</p>

<p>Notice that we added the 'availability="mandatory"' attribute.
This will ensure that the client will not start if if there are no
services available implementing the interface. If you started the client
before the service in any of the previous steps you would have seen a
stack trace, making the service mandatory avoids this issue.</p>

<p>The last step is to inject the 'greeterService' reference into
our test client using a property element. Add this line inside the bean
definition</p>
<div class=code>&lt;property name="proxy"
ref="greeterService"/&gt;</div>
<p>This will invoke the 'setProxy' method we added earlier and pass
in a blueprint service proxy, hooked up to any OSGi service
implementing the GreeterMessageService.</p>


<p>The complete blueprint.xml file should now look like this:</p>
<div class=code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;reference id="greeterService" interface="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api.GreeterMessageService"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout="10000" availability="mandatory"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;bean id="clientBean" class="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi.GreeterTestClient"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;init-method="doRequests"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;argument value="My blueprint client ID"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name="proxy"
ref="greeterService"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/bean&gt;<br>
&lt;/blueprint&gt;</div>
<p>That is all we need to do to the client. At this stage, rebuild
the client as you did at the end of the minimum conversion and watch it
running in the OSGi console. The steps are repeated here for
convenience.</p>

<p>To build the code, run the script build.sh (or build.bat) in the
[toplevel]/scripts directory. If you are using your own Maven repository
the commands are:</p>
<div class=code>
./build.sh org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.client.osgi<br>
</div>

<p>To run your sample, from the the [toplevel]/scripts directory:</p>
<div class=code>./run.sh</div>
<p>this will copy the jar files generated in the build step to
[toplevel]/dropins and hence install the application.</p>


<p>Now look back to the OSGi console, start the bundles (server
first!), and check that they run. Clean the dropins directory again by
removing all the files from it.</p>



<p>We're done with the client, and it's time to turn our attention
to the server side of things. Converting the server is very similar to
converting the client, but a lot simpler, as the only OSGi related bits
in the current server are limited to instantiating and registering the
service.</p>

<h1>Converting the OSGi service</h1>

<p>The service creation and registration is once again being handled
by a Bundle Activator, this time it's at..
<div class=code>
[toplevel]/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi/src/main/java/org/apache/tutorials/blueprint/greeter/server/osgi/ServiceRegisteringActivator.java
</div>
<p>Have a quick look at what this class is doing, make a quick note
of how it creates and initialises the service implementation, and how it
manages the service registration.</p>

<p>Delete the class. We'll be replacing it entirely with a blueprint
version.</p>
<p>Start by adding an OSGI-INF/blueprint directory to the
source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi/src/main/resources folder.</p>

<p>In the blueprint directory, create an xml file called
blueprint.xml.</p>

<p>In the xml file, add the main blueprint element and usual xml
boilerplate.</p>
<div class=code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"&gt;<br>
&lt;/blueprint&gt;<br>
</div>
<p>Let's start by having blueprint create the instance of the
implementation of our service. Add a bean element with the service
implementation class "GreeterMessageServiceImpl" as its target class.</p>
<div class=code>&lt;bean id="serverBean"
class="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi.GreeterMessageServiceImpl">
&lt;/bean></div>
<p>Now we need to initalise it, just as the original activator did.
The activator set the sender id in the Service by using the 'setSender'
method. We can have blueprint do this for us with a property element.</p>
<div class=code>&lt;property name="sender" value="Blueprint Greeting Service"/></div>
<p>Great... we have a server bundle, which if built and
deployed, would create an implementation of the service and set the
sender id on it. Unfortunately, no-one would be able to see it as we have not published it
to the OSGi registry. The blueprint '&lt;service&gt;' element is required to publish the service:</p>
<div class=code>&lt;service id="greeterService"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;interface="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api.GreeterMessageService"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ref="serverBean"&gt;<br>
&lt;/service&gt;</div>
<p>Putting it all together, you should have ended up with something
a little like this...</p>
<div class=code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;bean id="serverBean"
class="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi.GreeterMessageServiceImpl"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;property name="sender"
value="Blueprint Greeting Service"/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/bean&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;service id="greeterService"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interface="org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.api.GreeterMessageService"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ref="serverBean"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/service&gt;<br>

&lt;/blueprint&gt;<br>
</div>

<p>Finally, before you rebuild, you will need to edit the file:</p>
<div class=code>[toplevel]/source/org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi/pom.xml</div>
<p>and remove the line:</p>
<div class=code>
&lt;Bundle-Activator&gt;org.apache.aries.tutorials.blueprint.greeter.server.osgi.ServiceRegisteringActivator&lt;/Bundle-Activator&gt;
</div>
<p>When you build and deploy the server bundle now, we should be
able to see it all working as expected again.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have completed the final step in converting
the greeter application to use blueprint.</p>
