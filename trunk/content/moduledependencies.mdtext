# Module build time dependencies

There are build time dependencies between Aries modules. This diagram shows
the dependencies. For example, if you need to build 0.2-incubating JPA
module you will find that you need to have built (or have available)
parent, testsupport, util, blueprint, quiesce and transaction at the level
specified in the pom.xml for the JPA module.
