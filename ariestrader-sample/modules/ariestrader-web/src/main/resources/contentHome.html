		performance benchmark sample provides a suite of Apache developed
		workloads for characterizing performance of an Aries enabled Java EE
		Application Server. The workloads consist of an end to end web
		application and a set of primitives. The applications are a
		collection of Java classes, Java Servlets, Java Server Pages, and blueprint
		beans built to open OSGi and Java EE APIs. Together
		these provide versatile and portable test cases designed to measure
		aspects of scalability and performance.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

		AriesTrader is the Aries end-to-end benchmark and performance sample
		application. The new AriesTrader benchmark has been re-designed and
		developed to cover the application-focused specifications defined by the OSGi Alliance 
        Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) as implemented and extended in Apache Aries.
		This provides a real world workload driving an Aries's
		implementation of Aries enabled application servers.

		AriesTrader's new design leverages the OSGi programming model for Java EE applications.

		individually test various components of an Aries enabled Application
		Server. The primitives leverage portions of the AriesTrader application
		infrastructure to test specific Java EE components such as the
		servlet engine, JSP support, and more.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
