/**
 * A resolver is a service interface that can be used to find resolutions for
 * specified {@link Resource resources} based on a supplied {@link Environment}.

 * @ThreadSafe

public interface Resolver {
	/**
	 * Attempt to resolve the resources based on the specified environment and
	 * return any new resources and wires to the caller.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The resolver considers two groups of resources:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Mandatory - any resource in the mandatory group must be resolved, a
	 * failure to satisfy any mandatory requirement for these resources will
	 * result in a {@link ResolutionException}</li>
	 * <li>Optional - any resource in the optional group may be resolved, a
	 * failure to satisfy a mandatory requirement for a resource in this group
	 * will not fail the overall resolution but no resources or wires will be
	 * returned for this resource.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <h3>Delta</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * The resolve method returns the delta between the start state defined by
	 * {@link Environment#getWirings()} and the end resolved state, i.e. only
	 * new resources and wires are included. To get the complete resolution the
	 * caller can merge the start state and the delta using something like the
	 * following:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * Map&lt;Resource, List&lt;Wire&gt;&gt; delta = resolver.resolve(env, resources, null);
	 * Map&lt;Resource, List&lt;Wire&gt;&gt; wiring = env.getWiring();
	 *
	 * for (Map.Entry&lt;Resource, List&lt;Wire&gt;&gt; e : delta.entrySet()) {
	 * 	Resource res = e.getKey();
	 * 	List&lt;Wire&gt; newWires = e.getValue();
	 *
	 * 	List&lt;Wire&gt; currentWires = wiring.get(res);
	 * 	if (currentWires != null) {
	 * 		newWires.addAll(currentWires);
	 * 	}
	 *
	 * 	wiring.put(res, newWires);
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <h3>Consistency</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * For a given resolve operation the parameters to the resolve method should
	 * be considered immutable. This means that resources should have constant
	 * capabilities and requirements and an environment should return a
	 * consistent set of capabilities, wires and effective requirements.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The behavior of the resolver is not defined if resources or the
	 * environment supply inconsistent information.
	 *
	 * @param environment the environment into which to resolve the requirements
	 * @param mandatoryResources The resources that must be resolved during this
	 *        resolution step or null if no resources must be resolved
	 * @param optionalResources Any resources which the resolver should attempt
	 *        to resolve but that will not cause an exception if resolution is
	 *        impossible or null if no resources are optional.
	 *
	 * @return the new resources and wires required to satisfy the requirements
	 * 
	 * TODO I assume the list is mutable?
	 *
	 * @throws ResolutionException if the resolution cannot be satisfied for any
	 *         reason
	 * @throws NullPointerException if environment is null
