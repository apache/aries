/**

 * A HostedCapability is a Capability where the {@link #getResource()} method
 * returns a Resource that hosts this Capability instead of declaring it. This
 * is necessary for cases where the declared Resource of a Capability does not
 * match the runtime state. For example, this is the case for fragments attached
 * to a host. Most of the fragments declared capabilities and requirements
 * become hosted by the host resource. Since a fragment can attach to multiple
 * hosts, a single capability can actually be hosted multiple times.
