 * In Java 1.4, this class only works on non-generic types. In those cases, a
 * Collapsed Type provides to the class and has no type arguments. Blueprint
 * extender implementations can subclass this class and provide access to the
 * generics type graph if used in a declaration. Such a subclass must
 * <em>collapse<em> the different <code>Type</code> instances into the 
 * collapsed form. That is, a form where the raw Class is available with its optional type arguments.
