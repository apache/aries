/**
 * A Blueprint Event.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>BlueprintEvent</code> objects are delivered to all registered <code>BlueprintListener</code>
 * service objects. BlueprintEvents must be asynchronously delivered in chronological order
 * with respect to each listener.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, when a listener is registered, the blueprint extender
 * will synchronously send to this listener the last event for each blueprint bundle managed
 * by this extender.  This replay of events is designed so that the new listener can
 * be informed of the state of each managed bundle.  Events sent during this replay will
 * have the {@link #replay} flag set. The blueprint extender must ensure that this replay phase
 * does not interfere with new events so that the chronological order of all events received
 * by the listener is preserved. If the last event for a given blueprint bundle is DESTROYED,
 * the extender must not send it during this replay phase.
 *
 * <p>
 * A type code is used to identify the type of event. The following event types are defined:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #CREATING}
 * <li>{@link #CREATED}
 * <li>{@link #DESTROYING}
 * <li>{@link #DESTROYED}
 * <li>{@link #FAILURE}
 * <li>{@link #GRACE_PERIOD}
 * <li>{@link #WAITING}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <h2>Blueprint Events and EventAdmin</h2>
 * In addition to calling the registered {@link BlueprintListener}s, the blueprint extender
 * must also send those events to the EventAdmin service, if it is available. <br/>
 * See {@link EventConstants} for more informations.
