# This file is used in creating the table of current releases on the web site 
# and for downloading released bundles and copy in to the dist directory.
# It is a list of bundles and most recent released versions.
# The lis (but not teh version information) is generated using the script ../scripts/list_bundles_in_aries.pl
#
# Note: list_bundles_in_aries.pl does not pick up the eba maven plugin.
#
# Note: This file is read by two other scripts, download_release_artifacts.pl and create_modules_table.pl as part of the release process.
