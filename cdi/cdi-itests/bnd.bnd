Bundle-Description: Integration Test bundle for the CDI Extender
Export-Package: ${p}.cases.*,${p}.interfaces.*
Test-Cases: ${classes;CONCRETE;ANNOTATED;org.junit.Test}

##
## All of remainder is to make bnd's `-make` function work in our maven project.
##

# We need to define a root package so we can split the classpath contents into many `sub-bundles`.
p = org.apache.aries.cdi.test

# This is the instruction containing the make recipe and the recipe dir pattern for finding the bnd files.
-make: (*).(jar); type=bnd; recipe="${.}/bnd/$1.bnd"

# Finally, include the `-make'd` jars in the test bundle. This also happens to trigger the make function
# so don't forget to list new jars here as new bnd files are added into the recipe dir.
