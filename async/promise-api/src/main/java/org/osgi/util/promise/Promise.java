/**
 * A Promise of a value.
 * <p/>
 * A Promise represents a future value. It handles the interactions to for asynchronous processing. A Deferred object
 * can be used to create a Promise and later resolve the Promise. A Promise is used by the caller of an asynchronous
 * function to get the result or handle the error. The caller can either get a callback when the Promise is resolved
 * with a value or an error, or the Promise can be used in chaining. In chaining, callbacks are provided that receive
 * the resolved Promise, and a new Promise is generated that resolves based upon the result of a callback.
 * <p/>
 * Both callbacks and chaining can be repeated any number of times, even after the Promise has been resolved.
 * <p/>
 * Example callback usage:
 * <pre>
 * final Promise<String> foo= foo();
 * foo.onResolve(new Runnable() {
 * public void run() {
 * System.out.println(foo.getValue());
 * }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Example chaining usage;
 * <pre>
 * Success<String,String> doubler = new Success<String,String>() {
 * public Promise<String> call(Promise<String> p) throws Exception {
 * return Promises.resolved(p.getValue()+p.getValue());
 * }
 * };
 * final Promise<String> foo = foo().then(doubler).then(doubler);
 * foo.onResolve(new Runnable() {
 * public void run() {
 * System.out.println(foo.getValue());
 * }
 * });
 * </pre>
